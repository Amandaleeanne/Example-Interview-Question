# Example-Interview-Question
I was tasked with an Example interview question and the code inside this repo was written by me.

## The task:
1 Write the C#/Java code that implements a linked list
  2 Using an interface to define the LinkList definition, subclass the interface, and implement the
    following methods:
    A. Create the linked list and store class X (work, number) in each node in the list
    B. Load the link list with at least 25 words from a English dictionary using a class X. Each class x must have a work and number.
       The number should indicate the location in the list.
    C. Forward Traverse the list from the root and print the Class X's word and number
    D. Search for the 5th (number = 5) and print the word.
    E. Search for a word and print its number.
  3 Provide Unit Tests for each methods (A-E) to prove it works.

  Bonus points (optional)
    F. Reverse transversal the list and print out the work and number in reverse order.
       Also provide unit tests.
